I had a goal this year of reading 52 books, which was overly ambitious -- I only read 31. I'm glad I made the plan, though, because it made me keep a list, which I've never done before.

## Fiction

* *To the Bright Edge of the World*, Eowyn Ivey
* *Julian Comstock*, Robert Charles Wilson
* *World Made By Hand*, James Howard Kunstler
* *The Witch of Hebron*, James Howard Kunstler
* *A History of the Future*, James Howard Kunstler
* *The Book of Joan*, Lidia Yuknavitch
* *Men Without Women*, Haruki Murakami
* *The Nightmare Stacks*, Charles Strauss
* *American War*, Omar El Akkad
* *Lovecraft Country*, Matt Ruff
* *The Underground Railroad*, Colson Whitehead
* *The Delirium Brief*, Charles Stross
* *Warlock*, Oakley Hall
* *Rogue Male*, Geoffrey Household

I am not a discriminating reader -- I like almost all fiction I read. There's not a book I read in this category I didn't like somewhat, although the Kunstler books were the biggest let down. They're post-apocalyptic, which is a genre I groove on hard, but reading _World Made By Hand_, I started to get a weird vibe about how women, minorities, and gay people where treated, but it was subtle enough that I put it aside. _The Witch of Hebron_ wasn't quite as bad, so I put it aside, but _A History of the Future_ definitely gave me the heebie-jeebies. I looked up the author, and of course he's a bigot, the kind that thinks they're smarter than everyone else and they have special insight that the rest of us sheeple are missing out on. Fuck that guy and his books. I know people say "separate the artist from the art," but once I knew what was up, so many things in the books made more sense.

My two favorite books were the first one and one of the last ones I read, _To the Bright Edge of the World_ and _Warlock_. Both are stories of the Old West, although quite different. _To the Bright Edge of the World_ is about a woman left behind as her husband goes off to explore Alaska and her own personal journey, and _Warlock_ is an almost absurdly masculine novel about the clash of male egos in a small Arizona town. It has Stephen King-level stand-ins for God and the Devil, with God as a drunken one-legged judge and a cool murdering gambler as the Devil.

## Jesus books

* *Simply Christian*, N.T. Wright
* *The Man Who Quit Money*, Mark Sundeen
* *The Unsettlers*, Mark Sundeen
* *A People's History of Christianity*, Diana Butler Bass
* *A Prayer Journal*, Flannery O'Connor
* *Help Thanks Wow*, Anne Lamott
* *After You Believe*, N.T. Wright
* *Simply Jesus*, N.T. Wright
* *The Third Reconstruction*, Rev. Dr. William Barber II with Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove
* *Sinners in the Hands of a Loving God*, Brian Zahnd
* *In the Hands of a Happy God: The "No-Hellers" of Central Appalachia*, Howard Dorgan

I had a religious awakening in the last year that can't be summed up easily. It left me hungry to read as much as possible about a positive version of Christianity.

My favorite book in this category, _The Man Who Quit Money_, isn't actually a religious book. It's a study of [Daniel Suelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suelo), a man who has lived without spending money since 2000. His own religious upbringing both inspired him to live this way and caused him significant strife.

Other books I particularly enjoyed are *Simply Christian*, which helped me overcome a lot of the baggage from growing up Southern Baptist, and *Sinners in the Hands of a Happy God*, which is a fantastic tale of a pastor's journey.

## Other books

* *Zero Bugs and Program Faster*, Kate Thompson
* *Rosalie Lightning*, Tom Hart
* *Bitch Doctrine*, Laurie Penny
* *Life in Code*, Ellen Ullman
* *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI*, David Grann
* *Unbelievable*, Katy Tur
* *Beginning Spring Boot 2*, K. Siva Prasad Reddy

It's strange how few technical books I read. *Zero Bugs and Program Faster* was a must-read for its overly confident title alone. It was pretty great. Laurie Penny and Ellen Ullman are fantastic writers and their books rocked me.
