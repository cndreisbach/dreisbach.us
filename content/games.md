I've written roleplaying games since 2000, and have recently started dabbling with hypertext games and interactive fiction.

I have a newsletter about games, [Prismatic Word Spray](https://tinyletter.com/prismaticwordspray), that you will likely enjoy. [Subscribe now!](https://tinyletter.com/prismaticwordspray)

### The Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni

I wrote this [Twine](https://twinery.org/) game for [Ludum Dare 36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview). It was my first attempt at a hypertext game, and I had a good time putting it together.

### Owl Hoot Trail

{{< figure src="/img/games/oht.png" alt="Owl Hoot Trail cover" >}}

My favorite of the games I've written, _Owl Hoot Trail_ uses classic rules (that is, it resembles old school _D&D_) with a deadly twist to bring a fantasy Wild West to life. Half the book is a damn fine adventure, "They Rode to Perdition," by Kevin Kulp.

Check out a bottle adventure I wrote for _OHT_: [The Box](/games/the-box.pdf) (PDF).

### The Shadow of Yesterday

{{< figure src="/img/games/tsoy.png" alt="The Shadow of Yesterday cover" >}}

_The Shadow of Yesterday_ is pulpy romantic sword-and-sorcery at the end of one world and the beginning of the next. This game melds the best of standard fantasy role-playing and a hard-charging narrative engine. Set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world where the creation of a moon has ravaged cultures and thrown the fate of the earth into question, TSOY is like a _Weird Tales_ contribution written by Emily Bronte.

### The Princes' Kingdom

{{< figure src="/img/games/tpk.png" alt="The Princes' Kingdom cover" >}}

_The Princes’ Kingdom_ is a game in which you and your friends act out the adventures of children in faraway lands. These lands are all across an ancient ocean, and are all ruled by a wise king. You play the king’s children, princes, sent out to explore the kingdom and help out the citizens. The kingdom is very large, made up of hundreds of islands, and so the king sends out his princes to survey it and find out what sort of problems people have across the lands, so that they may one day be wise rulers themselves.

The game is inspired by the critically-acclaimed _Dogs in the Vineyard_, and has a foreword from Vincent Baker, the author of that game.
