Today I was leaving the parking garage at work when I saw someone's lights were on and their car was off. I leave my lights on all the time and run down my battery on the reg, so I decided to do the right thing and stop and see if I could turn their lights off. I walk up to the car -- walking up to a car that is not yours feels extremely weird -- and test the door handle. It opens and I turn off the lights and then the driver's seat, which was reclined, flies up and a frightened older Asian man looks at me. I may have never jumped so high before. We stared at each other for a moment and then I said, "I'm sorry, I saw your lights were on" and then turned and booked it out of there. I am pretty certain I heard him say "Thank you," but I am not completely sure.
