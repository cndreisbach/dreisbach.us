I started reading Laurie Penny's _Unspeakable Things_ over lunch today and found the best sentence:

> Public 'career feminists' have been more concerned with getting more women into 'boardrooms', when the problem is that there are altogether too many boardrooms and none of them are on fire.

I have a feeling I am really going to enjoy this book.
