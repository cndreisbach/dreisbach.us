I had a really excellent birthday. On Saturday, the whole family spent the day together, going to [Prairie Ridge Ecostation](http://naturalsciences.org/prairie-ridge) in Raleigh, and later getting [ice cream](http://pincho-loco.business.site/) after dinner. On Sunday, me and the boys got to spend the day together and went to see my friends at [Emmaus Way](http://emmausway.net/), where we are talking about the inequalities in our communities. Today, I woke up to loaded biscuits, donuts, and time with the kids in the park with some of my favorite people. I ate a quarter of a watermelon, Korean BBQ, and churros and took a 90-minute nap. Crystal and the boys bought me a board game and some awesome travel clothes with hidden pockets. I got a high score on my favorite video game too at 1:30 this morning. This Labor Day weekend gets an A+.
