[bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow](https://www.lionsroar.com/bell-hooks-talks-to-john-perry-barlow/). This is some of the most mindblowing stuff I have read.

[Unlearning the Religion of Whiteness](https://collegevilleinstitute.org/bearings/unlearning-religion-whiteness/). Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove is a prophetic voice. I think he is right on that whiteness is the poison at the roots of American Christianity.

[Agenda](https://agenda.com/?utm_source=offscreenmag_com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter). Found this note-taking program this week. OS X only, but it is really tight. Enjoying it a lot.

[JavaScript’s a mess – and that’s a good thing](http://2ality.com/2018/02/js-backward-compatibility.html). The section "A Cleaner JavaScript" in this article contains a succinct list of things to do to make your JavaScript better immediately.

[Hyperapp for Redux refugees](https://medium.com/hyperapp/hyperapp-for-redux-refugees-2507c9dd1ddc). I am a sucker for hype, but Hyperapp is looking like a real nice option for future development.

[How Generative Music Works](http://teropa.info/loop/#/title). Maybe the best web-based slideshow I've seen.

[Mary Rose Cook live-codes a JavaScript game from scratch](https://vimeo.com/105955605). This is going to be required watching in my next front-end development course.
