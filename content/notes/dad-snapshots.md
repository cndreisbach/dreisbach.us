The other day, Dashiell and I were headed to Little River Regional Park to learn about birds together. Even though it's December, it was over 60 degrees out, so we had the windows rolled down. I was playing Public Enemy's "Welcome to the Terrordome" and he was shouting "louder! louder!" in the backseat while we drove through the NC countryside.
