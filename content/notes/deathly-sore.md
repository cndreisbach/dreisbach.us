I took my son Dashiell to something called [Defy Gravity](http://www.defygravity.us/durham/Home.aspx) today. It's a giant room filled with trampolines, plus something called a "ninja course."

Did you know jumping on trampolines is hard work? When I was a kid, I thought it was the easiest thing in the world. I barely survived this morning.

This is something I'm going to call a "moon pit." I have no idea how deep that pit of foam blocks is, because I never reached bottom. Dashiell could jump in and scamper out because he weighs 35 pounds. I weigh enough that it's kind of embarrassing and is better represented in binary: `11010010`. I would estimate it took me 1 minute per foot of area I had to cover in that pit of doom. The time I jumped as far as I could in was really fun while I was in the air and then 5 minutes of bootcamp-level exertion.
