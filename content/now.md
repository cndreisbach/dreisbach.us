I'm an academic director at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/) where I write curriculum to help adult career-changers become successful developers. I previously worked in the Center for Data Science at [RTI International](http://www.rti.org/), building dashboards with D3 and React and creating agent-based models with [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

I'm helping [Don't Waste Durham](http://dontwastedurham.org/), a local group working to reduce consumer waste, with their Green To Go program by building their web and mobile applications.
